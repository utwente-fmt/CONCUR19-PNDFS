# CONCUR19-PNDFS

This repository hosts supplementary material for the PNDFS paper titled _Automated Verification of Parallel Nested DFS_, submitted to [CONCUR'19](https://event.cwi.nl/concur2019), containing:

- The verified version of sequential NDFS in VerCors: `sequential_ndfs.pvl`;
- The verified version of swarmed NDFS: `swarmed_ndfs.pvl`;
- The verified version of parallel NDFS: `pndfs.pvl`; and
- Two optimisations to PNDFS described in the paper, namely "all-red" (`pndfs_allred.pvl`) and "early cycle detection" (`pndfs_earlycycledetection.pvl`).
